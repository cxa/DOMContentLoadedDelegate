# `DOMContentLoadedDelegate`

Need to evaluate JS on `UIWebView` safely? Wait until `- webViewDidFinishLoad:`. But it is too slow if there are many resources (e.g. images) to load. `DOMContentLoadedDelegate` lets you access DOM as soon as possible.

## How to Use

1. Add the `DOMContentLoadedDelegate` repository as a submodule of your application‚Äôs repository.
2. Drag and drop `DOMContentLoadedDelegate.xcodeproj` into your application‚Äôs Xcode project or workspace.
3. On the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù tab of your application target‚Äôs settings, add `DOMContentLoadedDelegate.framework` to the ‚ÄúEmbedded Binaries‚Äù section.

Set your class confirms to `DOMContentLoadedDelegate` and do things that required to access DOM in `- DOMContentLoaded:`.

Or, If you would prefer to use Carthage or CocoaPods, please pull request.
